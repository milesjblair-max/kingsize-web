                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    Kingsize Big &amp; Tall is an Australian family-owned menswear business built on one simple belief: every man deserves clothing that fits properly, feels comfortable, and reflects his personal style.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    Founded in 1972 with the opening of our first store in Inglewood, Western Australia, Kingsize was created to serve a market that had long been overlooked.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    From the beginning, the focus was not just on offering larger sizes. It was about understanding proportion, comfort, confidence, and the real needs of big and tall men. That philosophy continues to shape everything we do today.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    Over more than five decades, Kingsize has grown into one of Australia&apos;s most trusted destinations for big and tall menswear, with stores across multiple states and a long-standing online presence that began in the early days of ecommerce.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    Generations of customers rely on Kingsize not only for clothing, but for honest advice, dependable quality, and a shopping experience built on respect.
                </p>

                    What Kingsize stands for
                </h2>

                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    Kingsize exists to remove frustration from shopping and replace it with confidence.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    Big and tall clothing is not standard sizing with extra fabric. It demands thoughtful design, carefully selected brands, and a deep understanding of how garments should fit, move, and last over time.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    We focus on three things: <span className="font-bold">Fit integrity. Practical quality. Modern style.</span>
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    Every product is chosen to balance comfort, durability, and contemporary design — allowing customers to build a complete wardrobe without compromise.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    We work with leading Australian and international labels while continually sourcing styles that reflect how men live, work, and present themselves today.
                </p>

                    While our values remain unchanged, the way we serve our customers is evolving. We are modernising the business to make shopping simpler, more personalised, and more convenient across every touchpoint.

                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    We are investing in better systems, clearer information, and smarter ways to connect customers with the right products faster. The goal is not change for the sake of change. It is progress that strengthens what has always mattered: fit, trust, and long-term relationships.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-7 mb-4 text-gray-800">
                    As retail continues to shift into a more digital and customer-focused era, Kingsize is adapting with intention. We are combining decades of specialised expertise with modern tools that improve accuracy, reduce friction, and create a more seamless experience.
